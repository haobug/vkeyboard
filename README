Install this version into the plugins directory.  You will find a new toolbar item, which represents
a keyboard.  Clicking on this will let you choose your required languages for the keyboard
and then when you re-load your page into the editor, a larger keyboard icon will appear at
the bottom left-hand border of the editing window.  Click on this and th keyboard will 
pop up.  See http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:vkeyboard for more information.
