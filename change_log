  Removed some unsed code from keyboard.js, subsituted IE for IE6 when checking for
  up and down arrow entities for top row buttons, started IE6 at size 3, since
  the up and down arrows dont show up well at 2.
  
  Added an insert function to keyboard.js which fixes problem with Firefox, i.e. returning
  to top of editing window when entering text below the bottom boundary of the
  editing window. This comes from http://www.scottklarr.com and is selected when
  Firefox is active, while the greywyvern insert function is selected for all
  other cases.
